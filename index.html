            <p id="para" class="card-text" style="text-align: center;">Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat Maulana Ilyas Attar Qadiri is the founder of the international
              movement of the devotees of Rasool for the preaching of Quran and Sunnah, Dawat-e-Islami with its millions
              of followers spread around the six continents of the globe. Here is a brief introduction to the life and
              services of this great Islamic personality:


              
              Childhood and Ancestors:
              Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat Allama Maulana Ilyas Qadiri was born on the 26th of Ramadan, 1369 Hijri (1950 AD) in
              Karachi, Pakistan. His ancestors belonged to Kutyana, Junagadh, India. The piety, virtues and exemplary
              character of his grandfather were well-known in the area. Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat’s parents moved to Pakistan
              after the partition in 1947. They first lived in Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan but later came to
              Bab-ul-Madinah Karachi. Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat’s father Haji Abdul Rahman Qadiri was steadfast on Islamic
              guidelines and was a righteous individual. He would often walk with a lowered gaze and knew many Ahadith
              by heart. He never showed any interest in accumulating the worldly materialistic wealth. He was also a
              disciple of the Noble Shaikh Ghaus -e- Azam Abdul Qadir Jilani رَحْمَۃُ اللہِ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہ in the
              esteemed Qadiriyyah order. Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat was still an infant when, during a Hajj pilgrimage in 1370
              Hijri, his father passed away due to an extreme heat wave in the plain of Mina on 14th Zulhijjah 1370
              Hijri receiving the distinct honor of departing this world during a Hajj pilgrimage. It is indeed an honor
              as the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہِ وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ has given the
              glad-tiding that “whoever dies during a Hajj pilgrimage, the reward of performing Hajj will be recorded
              for him till the Day of Judgment.”

              (Mu’jam Al-Awsat)
              


              
              Another Hadith states that whoever sets out for Hajj or Umrah and dies, he will not be brought to account
              on the Judgment Day nor will he have to face assessment and he will be told to enter Paradise.


              (Musnad Abu Ya’la)
             


              
                At such a young age, Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat lost his father and after that, his only brother Abdul Ghani
              also passed away in a train accident. Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat was brought up by his mother in challenging
              financial circumstances. She was a pious lady who, despite bearing hardships, raised her children with
              good morals and deep-rooted religious values. Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat had been fearful of Almighty Allah even
              in his early years. Once, his elder sister got upset with him for some reason and said, “Allah will punish
              you for this.” Upon hearing this, he was filled with the fear of Allah and became restless. He then kept
              imploring his sister to take her words back and say that “Allah will not punish you.” When his sister
              finally said those words, he attained peace of heart.

              

              
              Learning Years and His Passion for the Sacred Knowledge
              The blessed companion of the Holy Prophet صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہِ وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ Sayyiduna
              Ameer-e-Muawiya رَضِیَ اللہُ تَعَالٰی عَنْہُ has narrated that the Holy Prophet صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی
              عَلَیْہِ وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ said:


              مَنْ يُرِدِ اللَّهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُفَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّينِ


              “If Allah wants to do good to a person, He grants him the understanding of the religion”


              (Sahih Bukhari)

              

               
                From a very early age, Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat had a keen interest in learning the sacred religious
              knowledge. To quench his thirst for the sacred knowledge, he would read Islamic books and remain in the
              company of Islamic scholars, particularly, the Grand Mufti of Pakistan, Mufti Waqar-ud-Din Qadiri Ridawi
              رَحْمَۃُ اللہِ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہ, in whose blessed tutelage, Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat spent about twenty-two
              years and also received the honor of being his spiritual successor. As a result, Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat is
              proficient in and well acquainted with the sacred Islamic laws, guidelines of spirituality (Tasawwuf) and
              code of morals and ethics due to his immense passion of reading and constant interactions with the
              prominent scholars. The works of Imam Muhammad bin Muhammad Al-Ghazali (1058-111 AD) in Tasawwuf and Imam
              Ahmed Raza Khan Barelwi (1856-1921 AD) in Fiqh (Islamic Law) have particularly inspired him. He considers
              Imam Ahmed Raza Khan رَحْمَۃُ اللہِ تَعَالٰی عَلَیْہ as his ideal personality.

               

               Religious and Academic Services
                Sayyiduna Abu Hurairah رَضِیَ اللہُ تَعَالٰی عَنْہُ reports that the Holy Prophet صَلَّی اللہُ تَعَالٰی
                عَلَیْہِ وَاٰلِہٖ وَسَلَّمَ said:
  
                إِذَا مَاتَ الإِنْسَانُ انْقَطَعَ عَنْهُ عَمَلُهُ إِلاَّ مِنْ ثَلاَثَةٍ إِلاَّ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ
                أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ
  
  
                “When a man dies, his acts come to an end, but three, recurring charity, knowledge that benefits people,
                or a pious child, who prays for him”
  
                (Sahih Muslim) 


               In addition to his other religious services, Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat is one of those scholars who have
              authored books to gain the blessings of the aforementioned Hadith. He has written a number of books and
              booklets on topics ranging from the rulings of Salah to reforming the inner-self. These books have
              inspired millions to change their sinful ways and repent of their sins. Many of his books have been
              rendered into a number of local and foreign languages and more work is in progress as of now. In 1981, he
              founded the movement “Dawat-e-Islami” with this revolutionary Madani aim that, “I must strive to reform
              myself and the people of the entire world”. The Madani message of this movement has currently reached more
              than 190 countries and its Madani activities are being carried out in more than 103 walks of life from
              hospitals to prisons and from schools to universities. Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat has reinvigorated the spirit
              to follow the Sunnah in countless individuals especially the youth who have now become strict adherents of
              the sacred Islamic laws and now lead their lives as per the teachings of Islam and Sharia. By virtue of
              Dawat-e-Islami, thousands of non-Muslims have embraced the light of Islam and countless sinful Muslims
              have reformed themselves and are now spreading the call towards righteousness themselves.
               

               At the age of 67, Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat still holds 2-3 hour question and answer sessions weekly at the
              global Madani Markaz of Dawat-e-Islami Faizan -e- Madinah in Bab-ul-Madinah Karachi where he provides
              guidance on religious as well as ethical matters. Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat is a Shaikh (Spiritual Guide) of
              the Qadiriyyah Sufi order with Ijazah (Authorization) from a number of Mashaikh (spiritual guides) of the
              Qadiriyyah Sufi order. Despite having such a wide following of Muslims, Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat leads a
              simple, moderate life always contemplating the hereafter and worrying about preserving his faith and
              enjoins his disciples to do the same.

              The blessed life and personality of Ameer-e-Ahl-e-Sunnat Maulana Ilyas Qadiri دَامَت بَرَکاتُہُمُ
